# Project Maccuccin

Yahellow peeps! 👋

This is my long awaited MacOS rice!! 😁

I'm also planning on releasing a linux rice using hpyerland as the WM. So stay tuned for that also. 😉

## What's in here?

1. Custom configured `neovim`
2. Custom configured `tmux`
3. Customized and aliased `yt-dlp` scripts
4. Customized `Kitty` terminal config
5. `zsh suggestions` and `syntax highlighting`
6. Custom Starship theme for the prompt
7. `lsd` as the default `ls` command
8. `fzf`, `fd`, `ripgrep` installed and configured

## Theme

Almost all the cli tools are themed with `catppuccin mocha` flavor including the terminal (kitty).

## Prerequsistes

This setup useses `macports` to install the cli applications. <br>
So it's a must to install `Macports` before everything. _(You might want to install xcode command-line tools in order to install macports to your system)_.

## How to get and setup these dotfiles

1. Clone the repo
2. Move the `.config` folder to home directory. If it is already there just overwrite.
3. Run the `setup-all.sh` (This takes care of the rest 😎)
4. Done..!!
